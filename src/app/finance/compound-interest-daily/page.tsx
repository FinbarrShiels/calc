        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Daily compound interest is the addition of interest to the principal sum of a loan or deposit on a daily basis. This means that interest is calculated and added to your balance every day, rather than monthly, quarterly, or annually.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          The formula for compound interest with daily compounding is:

        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-2">Benefits of Daily Compounding</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-4">
          Daily compounding offers several advantages over less frequent compounding periods:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 ml-4 mt-2">
          <li>Higher effective annual yield</li>
          <li>Faster growth of your investment</li>
          <li>More frequent reinvestment of interest</li>
          <li>Greater long-term returns due to the power of compounding</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-2">Daily vs. Monthly Compounding</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
          While the difference between daily and monthly compounding may seem small in the short term, it can lead to significantly higher returns over longer investment periods. For example, a $10,000 investment at 5% interest for 30 years would yield approximately $43,219 with monthly compounding, but about $44,402 with daily compoundingâ€”a difference of over $1,180.
